# SpotifyAutoLike

This is a simple program that automatically likes fully played songs on Spotify.

I made this primarily for cycling, as I skip songs I don't like, and if I fully play a song, it means I like it.

## How to use

1. Get a hold of the release exe
2. Run the exe
3. Complete the authorization flow

## How to build

```
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64
```
